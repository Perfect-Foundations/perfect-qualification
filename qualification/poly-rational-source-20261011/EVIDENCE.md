# Source-exact Arithmetic M4 / Rational M5 / Polynomial integration

Executed 2026-10-10 America/New_York; final Qualification evidence for the authorized draft experimental source graph. This current consumer was updated from the previous graph in Git history (parent `5f169e2`); the independent historical `fused-git-graph-20261010` consumer is unchanged.

## Exact source revisions

- Numeric: `19b6747cd852a47a694a020b97ba70b6b3ef259b`
- Arithmetic: `65d8f55641739d5d6a11c17fe7d68c8898d984d7`
- Rational: `020c1a354f86f80ea9dd0af767f8e706f509ff08`
- Polynomial: `8d51179eac4bac7f879f268f8b56086249d57c43`

`source-exact.json` and `verify_graph.py` require the exact source Git identities, normalized Cargo.lock SHA-256, ten unchanged imported independent test-source SHA-256 values, SymPy fixture SHA-256, and current cross-operation test-source SHA-256. Cargo graph is `--locked --offline`; `cargo tree -d` shows no duplicate source identity. No `[patch]`, source override, new clone, worktree or replacement consumer.

## Final source-exact integration test matrix

| Execution environment | No default features | All features |
|---|---:|---:|
| Windows x86-64 | 28/28 passed | 28/28 passed |
| Ubuntu WSL2 Linux x86-64 | 28/28 passed | 28/28 passed |
| QEMU user-mode Linux AArch64 | 28/28 passed | 28/28 passed |

All six `cargo test --locked --offline` executions returned zero. Each runs 25 frozen independent mathematical checks and three current cross-operation tests. The added cross-operation regression has independent CPython Fraction/integer results for signed unit Rational multiplication, integer-valued multiplication, Horner evaluation at 5/3, quotient/remainder by a signed constant and complete polynomial coefficients. The other two check exact mixed-denominator cross-operations, wide canonical zero normalization, polynomial GCD and fused Integer cancellation.

Windows all-target `cargo clippy -- -D warnings` passed both feature modes for the final Qualification consumer; Windows full Arithmetic, Rational and Polynomial source test/lint matrices also passed, and Rustfmt checked. Ubuntu WSL2 complete Rational and Polynomial source suites passed both feature modes at the final pinned revisions; Arithmetic M4 complete WSL2 source suites were previously executed against unchanged `65d8f55`. New changed-operation focused tests passed on QEMU in both feature modes when separately executed prior to this source graph; this final 28-test consumer additionally passed QEMU both modes.

Independent `verify_m4_m5_python.py` exact reference script passed 14 Integer/Fraction vectors on Windows and Ubuntu WSL2, both with SHA-256 `87ab8e114247fbb3df5489708821e8fe985693e461ef7ee1f4e7dd9c59b204b6`.

## Production scope and performance evidence

Arithmetic `65d8f55` optimized exact fused subtract from a zero accumulator. Rational `020c1a3` includes shared-denominator addition, unit denominator construction, signed-unit multiplication/division, integral Rational multiplication and the exact Arithmetic dependency pin. Polynomial `8d51179` includes exact derivative exponent conversion, bounded LCM/sparse multiplication optimizations, Horner leading-coefficient initialization and final Rational/Arithmetic source pins.

Matched selected release-mode baseline/candidate trials: Rational 256-bit multiply by +1 ~359 ns to ~48 ns, 8192-bit divide by +1 ~562 ns to ~86 ns; integral Rational 256-bit multiplication ~476 ns to ~136 ns, while a 256-bit mixed-denominator workload regressed ~1622 ns to ~2006 ns. Horner constant Integer evaluation ~42 ns to ~7 ns, degree-one Integer evaluation ~36 ns to ~24 ns; long Rational evaluations were comparable with some small regressions. These measurements are workload-specific; no universal acceleration, memory-allocation savings or formal statistical distribution is claimed. Unprofitable Polynomial field-division and LCM-scaling candidate changes were not retained.

## Qualification boundary

This is verified exact behavior for the executed configurations, not physical ARM64, formally accepted M1/M2/M4/M5 milestones, exhaustive proof, security/API approval, hosted CI success, or release. Hosted Actions are externally billing-blocked. Perfectπ and unrelated source trees were not accessed or altered.
